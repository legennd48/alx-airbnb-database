# Database Script 0x02 - Seed Data

This directory contains the SQL script (`seed.sql`) for populating the Airbnb-like database with initial sample data.

The `seed.sql` file includes `INSERT` statements for the following tables:
- `user`: Sample users (guests and hosts).
- `property`: Sample property listings.
- `booking`: Sample booking records.
- `payment`: Sample payment records for bookings.
- `review`: Sample reviews for properties.
- `message`: Sample messages between users.

This data is intended for development and testing purposes, allowing you to interact with a populated database immediately after setting up the schema.
